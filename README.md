# Lending Club Case Study
> The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default
Analyse the Lending applicants data of Lending Club from 2007 to 2011
Minimise the risk of losing money while lending to urban customers
Avoid Financial loss by not lending to applicants likely to default
Identify the Patterns for applicants likely to default
> Objective -
> Avoid Business loss by lending to applicants who likely to repay the loan
Avoid Financial Loss by rejecting applicants who are likely to default

- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default
Analyse the Lending applicants data of Lending Club from 2007 to 2011
Minimise the risk of losing money while lending to urban customers
Avoid Financial loss by not lending to applicants likely to default
Identify the Patterns for applicants likely to default
- We have dataset named Loan which we are using to analyse this loan data of company.

# Conclusions
## Term is directly proportional to Loan Amount.
## Grade is directly proportional to Loan Amount.
## Interest rate is directly proportional to Loan Amount.
## Annual Income is directly proportional to Loan Amount.
## Interest Rate is directly Proportional to Term.
## Interest Rate is directly Proportional to Grade.
## home_ownership doesnot have much effect on Interest rate.
## Interest Rate is not related to Annual_income.
## Interest rate is directly proportional to Verification_status.
## Interest Rate does not have relation with Issue_Month.
## As DTI increases, Int_rate also increases but for DTI with 25-30, interest rate is less. 
## Interest rate is directly proportional to pub_rec_banruptcies.
## if the term is 36 months, there is only 10.7% charged off loans,
## but if 60 months, ther is 25.1% charged off loans
## if loan amount is more, then there is high chances of being defaulters.
## if higher the interest rate higher is the amount of defaulters, Loan_status is directly proportional to Int_rate. 
## loans with lower grade have less chances of defaulting, while with higher grade - defaulters are also higher
## emp_length has very less influence on Loan_status
## home_ownership has less influence on why there are defaulters.
## Loan_status is inversely proportional to Annual Income.
## Verification status has minimum effect on Loan_status.
## Year does not have much influence.
## defaulters will be less when loans are approved in the beginning of year, but in the end this difference is not much. 
## loans on Small_business and renewable_energy will default the most. 
## DTI is directly proportional to loan_status
## people with 1 pub_rec have more defaulters when compared to others
## Loan_status is directly proportional to pub_rec-bankruptcies.
